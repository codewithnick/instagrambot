# instagrambot
spammer bot for instagram

# note:
the bot on github may or may not work according to the current version of instagram .newer versions are not yet open sourced

# how does the bot work?

the bot uses sophisticated and complicated algorithms to find geniune user on instagram and drive them to a specified account or page which increases the reach and impressions of your page overall. hernce inderectly increasing your following base.
in other words the bot works to advertise your account to potential followers
the bot will log in to your account everyday and will work for 18 hours nonstop.
the bot will first find potential users ,these users will be the users which have been interacting with similar pages to your niche so they have a higher chance of following you.
then the bot runs algorithms to decide what kind of interaction will be best for the user .interaction may include (liking the users post, commenting on their post and messaging them directly to follow you). this process runs every hour thus driving a huge amount of traffic to your account.

# how many impressions do I get per day after using this bot?

the bot will on average message 2 people per hour, like 10 posts of 7 users per hour, comment on 3 posts per hour 
that will be (2+7+3)* 18 hours -> i.e. 216 impressions atleast per day on average.this is the least number and atleast 216 people can be driven to your account in a span of a week through the bots one day of work.
(these variables vary, but these limits are applied to stop your account from getting banned from excess usage.)

# is using bots illegal and can get you banned on instagram?

you may have probably heard about services which guarantee you a number of followers. never opt for them ,they are sure to get you banned. our bot on the other hand uses marketing techniques by humans and automates them  on targeted potential followers to increase your reach
## main reasons for getting banned on instagram may include
-liking too many posts in a small interval of time
-commenting the same things too many times frequently
-messaging too many new users frequently
-spending and surfing on instagram and viewing many profiles
-following/unfollowing too frequently
-getting too many temporary bans
-messaging a lot of new people per hour
-creating too many groups
-liking more than 2000 posts per day
-having more than 60 interactions per hour
-using abusive languages in your post and story

our bot takes care of all these limits ,imagine how tedious it will be to wait for every 30 seconds to interact with someone to avoid bans and still drive traffic to your account .with our bot you can sit back and see as the bot takes care of all this limits and drives huge traffic to your account everyday
